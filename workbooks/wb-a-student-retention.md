# Building a model to predict student attrition from High School

*Author*: Matt Niksch

*Synopsis*:
- Noble is a non-profit operator of 17 high schools in Chicago and serves more than 10% of public high school students in the city
- Student outcomes, including high school graduation, test score growth, GPA, college matriculation & completion are very strong
- However, although better than nearby options, too many students leave Noble and transfer to other schools. We would like to predict which students are likely to leave in order to provide them with more supports.

### Summary of potential features we might use to predict labels related to student depature:
![Features](./PotentialFeatures.png)

## To start, we are going to construct features from crime data provided by the City of Chicago
This data is available for download or API access [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2) 


```python
# The next few cells are all Python manipulations of the data if you're only interested in results,
# Skip down for the next text/markdown section
# First some library imports

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

```


```python
# This next block takes the enormous data file and breaks it down into annual chunks that work in local memory
# It only needs to be run once.

# (The entire dataset is downloaded locally:)
crime_file = 'Crimes_-_2001_to_present.csv'

# This file is too large to read in its entirety, so we'll read in chunks one year at a time and then save as smaller files
for year in range(2001,2018):
    print('Reading {}...'.format(year),end='',flush=True)
    iter_csv = pd.read_csv(crime_file, index_col=0, iterator=True, chunksize=1000)
    cdf = pd.concat([chunk[chunk['Year'] == year] for chunk in iter_csv])
    print('saving to csv', flush=True)
    cdf.to_csv('Crimes_-_{}.csv'.format(year))
```

### The above shows a sample of the data, in order to be more meaningful in our analysis, we'd like to distinguish between types of crimes

We'll likely want to build two crime indices. One based on all crimes and the other for murder and weapon/drug related ones. Those were suggested by our Director of Discipline as the most disruptive to student life, particularly because they tend to be gang related.

First, though, let's look at the general categories of data and assume these are typical for all years


```python
# One of the things we'll be interested in is the type of crime, so let's look first at the "Primary Type":
cdf['Primary Type'].value_counts()

# To summarize the above:

We've constructed a reference of the types of crimes we suspect might be most harmful to children growing up in their vicinity.

Based on this sample of data (2017 YTD), slightly more than 10% (12% in this case) of the crime in the city is "serious"

## Next, we'll work to geocode the data uniformly

While there exists geocoding for all of the 2017 data above, it unfortunately didn't start in the data serious until 2016. We'll next work to build a database of uniform geocodes by block


```python
blocks = cdf.Block.unique()
print('There are a total of {} blocks in this data sample'.format(len(blocks)))
```

    There are a total of 26568 blocks in this data sample

## You can note that the latitudes and longitudes are similar

This [source](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/8650/measuring-accuracy-of-latitude-and-longitude/8674#8674) gives a good overview of the precision of latitude and longitude decimal places. The 3rd decimal provides about 100m of precision.

For this data, we'll average the lat/lon locations and then round to 3 digits to create a uniform location per block. If there are blocks in the older data sets that don't have lat/lon information (e.g. because there was no crime in 2016/2017), then we'll attempt to use public libraries to first geocode a median block location (042XX will become 04250) and then average to 3 decimals.


```python
rounded_lat_lon = cdf[['Block', 'Latitude', 'Longitude']].groupby(['Block']).mean().round(3)
print(rounded_lat_lon.head(10))
```

                      Latitude  Longitude
    Block                                
    0000X E 100TH PL    41.712    -87.622
    0000X E 100TH ST    41.713    -87.622
    0000X E 101ST PL    41.710    -87.622
    0000X E 101ST ST    41.711    -87.622
    0000X E 102ND PL    41.708    -87.622
    0000X E 102ND ST    41.709    -87.622
    0000X E 103RD PL    41.706    -87.622
    0000X E 103RD ST    41.706    -87.622
    0000X E 104TH ST    41.705    -87.622
    0000X E 105TH ST    41.703    -87.622
    

## Looking at the above, which happen to be parallel East-West streets

It seems that the approach of rounding to the 3rd decimal produces consistent results.

We can then combine this lat/long info with the crime counts to create a full source table for looking at students (for 2017)


```python
serious_crime_count = cdf[['Block', 'serious']].groupby(['Block']).sum() 
all_crime_count = cdf[['Block', 'serious']].groupby(['Block']).count() #this will have a 'serious' header we need to change
all_crime_count.rename(columns={'serious':'all_crimes'}, inplace=True)
block_crime_data = pd.concat([all_crime_count, serious_crime_count, rounded_lat_lon], axis=1)
print(block_crime_data.head(10))
```

                      all_crimes  serious  Latitude  Longitude
    Block                                                     
    0000X E 100TH PL          23        5    41.712    -87.622
    0000X E 100TH ST          21        3    41.713    -87.622
    0000X E 101ST PL          11        5    41.710    -87.622
    0000X E 101ST ST           3        0    41.711    -87.622
    0000X E 102ND PL          21       10    41.708    -87.622
    0000X E 102ND ST          16        5    41.709    -87.622
    0000X E 103RD PL           8        2    41.706    -87.622
    0000X E 103RD ST          40        6    41.706    -87.622
    0000X E 104TH ST          11        6    41.705    -87.622
    0000X E 105TH ST           4        0    41.703    -87.622
    

# Great!

We now have a table of crime and serious crime by block. The next step will be to tie it to a specific location.

To do this, we can create a function that returns all of the crime within a rectangular range around a given lat/long.


```python
# Let's start with the address of a randomly selected student
block_crime_data.loc['009XX N MENARD AVE']
```




    all_crimes     3.000
    serious        1.000
    Latitude      41.898
    Longitude    -87.770
    Name: 009XX N MENARD AVE, dtype: float64




```python
def give_radius_crime(df,lat,lon,plusminus):
    '''Returns a tuple of (all_crime, serious_crime) around the provided lat/long plus or minus the final field'''
    df_local = df[((lat-plusminus) <= df['Latitude']) &
                  ((lat+plusminus) >= df['Latitude']) &
                  ((lon-plusminus) <= df['Longitude']) &
                  ((lon+plusminus) >= df['Longitude'])]
    print(df_local)
    serious = df_local['serious'].sum()
    all_crime = df_local['all_crimes'].sum()
    return (all_crime, serious)
```


```python
block_label = '009XX N MENARD AVE'
this_block = block_crime_data.loc[block_label]
for sensitivity in [0.001, 0.0015, 0.002]:
    print('Crime count for sensitivity of {}'.format(sensitivity))
    this_block_crimes = give_radius_crime(block_crime_data, this_block['Latitude'],
                                         this_block['Longitude'], sensitivity)
    print('Total of {} instances of crime for {}, {} of which were serious'.format(this_block_crimes[0],
                                                                              block_label,
